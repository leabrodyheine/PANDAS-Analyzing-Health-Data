# PANDAS-Analyzing-Health-Data
This project was about cleaning and analyzing health data using PANDAS. The mini_pandas.py file has the actual functions while the testing file actually outputs a result. The first 4 tests do not pass because they are theoretical, but the last 3 should pass and show graphs when you run the tests. 

You must have matplotlib installed and the 3 CSV files that the mini_pandas file reads.
