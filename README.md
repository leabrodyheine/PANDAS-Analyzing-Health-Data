# PANDAS-Analyzing-Health-Data

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the analysis of health data using the PANDAS library. It provides a set of functions for cleaning and analyzing health data, allowing users to visualize and interpret the findings effectively.

## File Structure
1. **mini_pandas.py** - This is the primary file containing all necessary functions for data cleaning and analysis.
2. **testing** - This file is responsible for executing tests and producing results. Note that the first four tests are theoretical and hence do not pass. However, the subsequent three should pass and also generate visual results using graphs.

## Prerequisites
1. Python's `matplotlib` library should be installed to visualize the data effectively.
   
   You can install it using pip

   The project requires three specific CSV files for the data source, which `mini_pandas.py` reads. Ensure you have these files available in the appropriate directory or update the paths in the script accordingly.

## How to Use
1. Ensure you've met all the prerequisites.
2. Run the `testing` file to initiate the tests and visualize the output.
